# Using TreeSAPP for global-scale gene-centric microbial ecology

## Description

This work aims to clear up some misconceptions and long-standing unknowns to uncover best practices when conducting 
gene-centric analysis using phylogenetic placement methods.
All analyses relied on TreeSAPP's<sup>[1](#references)</sup> methods of creating reference packages and assigning taxonomic labels.
However, the takeaways are broadly applicable to other tools working with phylogenetic placements such as pplacer, EPA-NG and Genesis, GraftM and PhyloMagnet.
